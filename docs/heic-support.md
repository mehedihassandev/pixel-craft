# HEIC Support Implementation

## Overview

The photo editor now supports HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) format, which is commonly used by Apple devices like iPhones and iPads.

## Features Implemented

### 1. HEIC Input Support

- ✅ Accept HEIC files in upload zone (`.heic`, `.heif` extensions)
- ✅ Client-side HEIC processing using `libheif-js`
- ✅ Automatic conversion to JPEG for further processing
- ✅ Fallback handling if client-side processing fails

### 2. HEIC Output Support

- ✅ HEIC format option in conversion dropdown
- ✅ Converts to high-quality JPEG as HEIC alternative (broader compatibility)
- ✅ Clear user messaging about HEIC → JPEG conversion
- ✅ Maintains high quality (90%+ JPEG quality)

### 3. User Experience

- ✅ Informative tooltips and messages
- ✅ Progress indicators during conversion
- ✅ Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Batch processing support

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side HEIC Processing

```typescript
// Location: src/lib/heic-processor.ts
- Uses libheif-js for WASM-based HEIC decoding
- Converts HEIC to JPEG via HTML5 Canvas
- Handles both .heic and .heif extensions
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks
```

### Server-Side Processing

```typescript
// Location: src/app/api/image-convert/route.ts
- Uses Sharp for high-performance image processing
- HEIC output converts to high-quality JPEG
- Special headers indicate format conversions
- Resize and quality controls supported
```

### Format Configuration

```typescript
// Location: src/types/image-conversion.ts
- HEIC format properly configured
- Clear descriptions for users
- Quality control support
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:

1. **Upload HEIC files**: Simply drag and drop or select HEIC files from your Apple device
2. **Convert TO HEIC**: Select HEIC as target format (will output high-quality JPEG)
3. **Batch Processing**: Include HEIC in batch conversions
4. **Quality Control**: Adjust quality settings for optimal results

### For Developers:

1. **HEIC Detection**: Use `HEICProcessor.isHEICFile(file)` to detect HEIC files
2. **Processing**: Use `HEICProcessor.processIfHEIC(file, quality)` for conversion
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallbacks for unsupported browsers

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 67+ (WASM support)
- ✅ Firefox 52+ (WASM support)
- ✅ Safari 11+ (WASM support)
- ✅ Edge 16+ (WASM support)

## Performance Notes

- Client-side HEIC processing uses WASM for speed
- First HEIC conversion may take longer (WASM initialization)
- Subsequent conversions are faster due to caching
- Large HEIC files (>20MB) may take several seconds

## Limitations

- HEIC output is converted to JPEG for compatibility
- Some metadata may be lost during conversion
- Animated HEIC sequences not supported (converts first frame)
- Requires modern browser with WASM support

## Testing

To test HEIC support:

1. Visit `http://localhost:9002/photo-editor`
2. Upload a HEIC file from an iPhone/iPad
3. Try converting to different formats
4. Test batch conversion including HEIC
5. Verify quality settings work correctly

## Error Scenarios Handled

- ✅ HEIC file corrupted or invalid
- ✅ Browser doesn't support WASM
- ✅ libheif-js fails to load
- ✅ Out of memory during processing
- ✅ Network issues during upload
