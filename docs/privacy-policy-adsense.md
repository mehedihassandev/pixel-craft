# Privacy Policy - AdSense Disclosure

## Google AdSense

This website uses Google AdSense, a service for including advertisements from Google Inc. ("Google"). Google AdSense uses "cookies" (text files) that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Through these web beacons, information such as visitor traffic on these pages can be evaluated.

### Information Collected by AdSense

The information generated by cookies and web beacons about your use of this website (including your IP address) and delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google may pass on this information to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.

### Your Rights and Choices

- **Ad Personalization**: You can control ad personalization by visiting [Google Ad Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads)
- **Opt-out**: You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)
- **Cookies**: You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though this may affect website functionality

### Data Processing

Google will never associate your IP address with other Google data. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.

### Third-Party Advertising

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Environment Variable Configuration

This privacy policy documentation has been updated to reflect the new AdSense environment variable configuration without `NEXT_PUBLIC` prefixes.

### New Environment Variables (Server-side):

- `ADSENSE_PUBLISHER_ID` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_PUBLISHER_ID`)
- `ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_BANNER` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_BANNER`)
- `ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_RECTANGLE` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_RECTANGLE`)
- `ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_SIDEBAR` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_HOMEPAGE_SIDEBAR`)
- `ADSENSE_FOOTER` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_FOOTER`)
- `ADSENSE_TEST_MODE` (instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_TEST_MODE`)

### Architecture Changes:

- Server-side configuration loading in `src/constants/adsense-server.ts`
- Client-side context provider in `src/contexts/adsense-context.tsx`
- Updated components to use React context instead of direct environment variables
- Improved security by not exposing sensitive configuration to client-side
